# City Story session August 12th 2021

<!-- I had a shorter session yet again today, as I was low on time, so I produced candy bars (5 minutes) instead of jewelery boxes (15 minutes) I did tip collection today as well, not much was done overall. !--> <!-- I have been receiving an abnormal amount of neighbor requests lately. !-->

I had a long session today, doing collection, and producing Hula Hoops (15 minutes each) again today. I worked on my laptop while the stock was being produced, checking back on it a few times. I also made 2 batches of popsicles (1 minute each) today. Not much else was done.

## Overview

See above.
