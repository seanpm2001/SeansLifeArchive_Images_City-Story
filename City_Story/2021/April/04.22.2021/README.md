# City Story session April 22nd 2021

I had a usual session today. I did the usual jewelery box production, tip collection, and friend visits. I finally finished construction on my Police Station today, and also placed several residences, bringing my overall city happiness level down.

I had an idea for a city with the police station while it was under construction, being an American Civil War Deep South city, where all the buildings in the city looked like they had been destroyed, similar to how the police station looked while it was under construction.

## Overview

See above.
