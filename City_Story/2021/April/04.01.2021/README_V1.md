# City Story session April 1st 2021

I had a normal session today that lasted over 25 minutes

## Remodeling

No remodeling was done today.

## Cleaning

I cleaned most of my neighbors cities today (except for cities that couldn't be cleaned anymore) and I collected enough XP to reach level 15 on my own city.

## Factory

I made a batch of 5 jewelery boxes, and afterwards stocked up over 100,000 coins (plus over 3000 coins for next weeks jewelery boxes) by making many batches of popsicles.

I am saving up for the special factory. I am hoping that it is a factory like in other Storm8 games where the order never expires. If not, it will still be a cool item to have.

## Revenue

Some revenue was made today.
