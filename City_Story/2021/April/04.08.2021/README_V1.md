# City Story session April 8th 2021

I had a normal session today. I did the usual collection, cleaning, and gifting process. I am getting closer to being able to buy and unlock the 15x15 expansion.

## Cleaning

I collected rewards from my neighbors cleaning my city, and I went and cleaned as many buildings as I could on all my neighbors cities, as my jewelry was being produced.

## Production

I produced the usual 5 Jewelry kits today, and also produced tons of popsicles, and some candy bars afterwards.

## Remodeling

I decided to sell some excess buildings I received from my neighbors to get closer to being able to expand.

## 15x15 expansion

I am getting very close to unlocking the 15x15 expansion. I met the neighbor requirement a while back, it has just been taking me a while to stock up 200000 coins, especially when I only play once per week.
