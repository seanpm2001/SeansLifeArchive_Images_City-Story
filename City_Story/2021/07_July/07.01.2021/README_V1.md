# City Story session July 1st 2021

I had a shorter session yet again today, as I was low on time, so I produced candy bars (5 minutes) instead of jewelery boxes (15 minutes) I did tip collection today as well, not much was done overall. I have been receiving an abnormal amount of neighbor requests lately.

## Overview

See above.
