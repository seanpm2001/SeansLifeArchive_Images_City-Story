# City Story session July 15th 2021

<!-- I had a shorter session yet again today, as I was low on time, so I produced candy bars (5 minutes) instead of jewelery boxes (15 minutes) I did tip collection today as well, not much was done overall. !--> <!-- I have been receiving an abnormal amount of neighbor requests lately. !-->

I had a longer session today, doing collection, and producing jewelery boxes and lots of popsicles. Not much else was done.
